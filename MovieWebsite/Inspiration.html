In our modern world people forget how important it is to Disconnect from work and studies, the actors were quiet surprised to see the daily life of students. Dino Cup having spent most of his life
in a china cabinet said that 'he can imagine the hardships of having to sit at the same place for a long time'. However what really inspired the movie and lit the spark was the book titled
"The little prince". Having read it constantly for the last 10 years it taught me that stepping away from things for a while is a venture worth going towards. Adding the music box into the video
transformed the same atmosphere of being at the Opera stadium (Videos listed below).
